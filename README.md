# Kármán–Trefftz Airfoil Flow Visualisation App

This MATLAB application was developed as part of my Bachelor’s thesis:  
**“Analysis and Visualisation in MATLAB of the Potential Flow Around Kármán–Trefftz Airfoil Profiles.”**

---

## Overview

The app provides an interactive environment to visualise the **potential flow** around **Kármán–Trefftz airfoil profiles**.  
It allows users to:
- Adjust the geometric parameters of the airfoil.  
- Visualise the profile, flow streamlines, velocity and pressure fields.  
- Observe the influence of geometric variations on aerodynamic flow behaviour.

This tool is intended for educational and analytical use in **aerodynamics and potential flow theory**.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB R2023a or later**  
- MATLAB App Designer  
- Community Functions (MATLAB File Exchange): 'arrow3.m', 'getContourLineCoordinates.m'

## How to Use

1. Download this repository.  
2. Open the file `KT_Analysis_GUI.mlapp` in **MATLAB App Designer**.  
3. Run the app by clicking **Run**.  
4. Use the input fields to modify airfoil parameters and visualise the resulting flow.
